"""
We can use FastAPI to create a basic HTTP/RESTful API in Python.

assumes that the following packages have been installed useing pip:
1. pip install fastapi
2. pip install uvicorn

Or, we can use the built-in fastapi command to run the API, but we'll need an additional package installation:
1. pip install "fastapi[standard]"

Altnatively, you we can use fastapi diectly from the command line:
1. uvicorn fastAPI:app --reload
