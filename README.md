&ensp;I've been a musician for about 25 years and have toured extensively in the south-east region of the US. In addition to my love for playing the drums, I also have an increased affection for health a fitness. There are a few musicians that have highlighted their passion for being in top physical shape; even some drummers like Andy Hurley and El Estepario Siberiano have made it very public how seriously they take their fitness. I was fortunate to have a background in athletics and a deep passion for healthy eating an exercise so I was able to maintain a very healthy lifestyle while touring, but that was not the case for many musicians that I met along my travels during the years I toured the most. The *one* thing I wish I could have provided to all those struggling musicians was some sort of resource for helpping them not only track their fitness goals but get specified workout routines and fitness plans based on the instrument they played. 

&ensp;The software system I would build would be a mobile application that provided instrument-specific exercise routines and eating plans.
